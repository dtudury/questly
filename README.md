promise returning browserifiable request wrapper

* _this project is currently very unstable;_
* _I __do__ promote to 1.x releases and I take the 0 in 0.x seriously (and this project is 0.0.x)_
* _and even though I'm using this I really don't see it getting even the minor bump until the node browser at least handles multiple cookies_
* _also I may flip-flop on the whole promises thing for this one_

##what's the point?

the idea is to make node pretend to be a browser (because the opposite is often impossible).  also it's much lighter weight than the browserify http module.
